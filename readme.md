### Features

- Timezone setting with UTC/GMT offset
- DST toggle

- What more could you want?

### To-do list

- [ ] Clean up code (I don't think I'm even using the NTPClient lib)
- [ ] Come up with a cleaner solution to the image arrays
- [ ] Add image selection to the web server
- [ ] I'm pretty sure Arizona has some half hour offset BS, so get that sorted out by being able to take a float from the web server
