### Features

- Timezone setting with UTC/GMT offset
- DST toggle
- Cute girls
- What more could you want?

### To-do list

- [ ] Clean up code (I don't think I'm even using the NTPClient lib)
- [x] Come up with a cleaner solution to the image arrays
- [x] Add image selection to the web server
- [ ] Add info for girl/TZ choice
- [ ] Allow only one value to be set at a time
- [ ] I'm pretty sure Arizona has some half hour offset BS, so get that sorted out by being able to take a float from the web server
